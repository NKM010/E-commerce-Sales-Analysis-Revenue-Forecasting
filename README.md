# E-commerce Sales Analysis & Forecasting  
Analyzing e-commerce sales data to uncover insights, identify revenue trends, and forecast future performance using Python, SQL, and machine learning.

## Overview  
This project analyzes e-commerce sales data to uncover key business insights, identify revenue trends, and forecast future sales. By exploring customer behavior, product performance, and seasonal patterns, it supports strategic decision-making and inventory optimization.

## Key Insights  
- Identified peak sales periods and seasonal demand trends using time series analysis.  
- Pinpointed top-performing product categories driving revenue.  
- Discovered regional sales patterns tied to product types.  
- Flagged underperforming categories for potential improvement or removal.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- SQL  
- Scikit-learn (Regression models for forecasting)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Excel (initial transformation and cleaning)

## Dataset  
- Sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/allunia/e-commerce-sales-forecast).  
- Created by **Allunia**.  
- This dataset is licensed under the **Open Database License (ODbL)**.

## How to Use This Notebook  
1. Clone this repository or download the `.ipynb` file.  
2. Open it in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.  
3. Run the code to follow the analysis and view the forecasting results.

## Excel Analysis 
To demonstrate proficiency with spreadsheet tools, an exploratory analysis was also conducted in Excel (Google Sheets):

- Added a new column for Total Sales (`Quantity Ã— UnitPrice`).
- Cleaned data by removing rows with missing product descriptions and unspecified countries.
- Created a pivot table summarizing Total Sales per Country.
- Visualized the results using a bar chart of top-selling regions.
